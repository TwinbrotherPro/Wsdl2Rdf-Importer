# Wsdl2Rdf-Importer
The WSDL2RDF-Importer is a component for importing WSDL 2.0 files and converting them into a RDF-Graph.

The component implements the W3C specification for Mapping a WSDL 2.0 file into a RDF-Representation[1], by using the XSLT-File of Jacek Kopecky[2]. The file is processed by the XALAN-XSLT-Processor[3].

The component was implemented, by Philipp Kraus, during a Bachelor thesis at the University of Stuttgart.
